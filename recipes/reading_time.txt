{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the PROBLEM

 # put or write the user story here. add any notes
 > As a user
 > so that I can manage my time
 > estimate of reading time for a test, assuming I can read 200 words a min


. Design the Method Signature

 # include the name of the method, it's parametere, return value and side effects
    ruby
    estimate = reading_time(text)
    * text is a string containing words e.g. ("hte cat sat on the mat")
    * estimate is time taken to read the words

3. Create examples as texts

 # make a list of examples of what the method will take and return
 > 1 reading_time("") 
 return 0

 > 2 reading_time("hello " * 200) 
 return 1

 > 3 reading_time("hello " * 400)
 return 2

 > 4 reading_time("The cat. Sat on the mat! Miaow said the Cat")
 return 0.05

 # encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list


4. Implement the behaviour

 # after each test you write, follow the TD process of red, green refactor to 
 # implemet the behaviour
