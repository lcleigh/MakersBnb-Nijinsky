{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the PROBLEM

 # put or write the user story here. add any notes
 > As a user
 > So that I can analyse keywords in my texts
 > I want to see a list of uppercase words


. Design the Method Signature

 # include the name of the method, it's parametere, return value and side effects
    ruby
    uppercase = extract_uppercase(text)
    * text is a string containing words e.g. ("hello LAURA")
    * uppercase is a list of uppercase words ["LAURA"]

3. Create examples as texts

 # make a list of examples of what the method will take and return
 > 1 extract_uppercase("") 
 return []

 > 2 extract_uppercase("hello world") 
 return []

 > 3 extract_uppercase("hello LAURA") 
 return ["LAURA"]

 > 4 textract_uppercase("HELLO LAURA") 
 return ["HELLO", "LAURA"]

 > 5 extract_uppercase("HeLLo LaUrA") 
 return []

 > 6 extract_uppercase("HELLO! LAURA!") 
 return ["HELLO", "LAURA"]

 # encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list


4. Implement the behaviour

 # after each test you write, follow the TD process of red, green refactor to 
 # implemet the behaviour
