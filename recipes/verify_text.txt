{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the PROBLEM

 # put or write the user story here. add any notes
 > As a user
 > so that I can improve my grammer
 > I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.


. Design the Method Signature

 # include the name of the method, it's parametere, return value and side effects
    ruby
    verified_text = verify_text(text)
    * text is a string containing a sentence e.g. ("the cat sat on the mat")
    * verified_text will state if some text starts with a capital letter and ends with punctuation

3. Create examples as texts

 # make a list of examples of what the method will take and return
 > 1 verify_text("") 
 return "There is no text to check."

 > 2 verify_text("The Cat sat on the mat!") 
 return "This sentence is great."

 > 3 verify_text("the Cat sat on the mat!") 
 return "You need a capital letter at the beginning of this sentence."

 > 4 verify_text("The Cat sat on the mat") 
 return "You need some punctuation at the end of this sentence."

 > 5 verify_text("the cat sat on the mat")
 return " You need a capital letter at the beginning of this sentence and some punctuation at the end."

 # encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list


4. Implement the behaviour

 # after each test you write, follow the TD process of red, green refactor to 
 # implemet the behaviour
